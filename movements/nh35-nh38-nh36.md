No, you cannot simply remove the date wheel. The movements have different bridge configurations. However, some modders use date-less dials with NH35, simply hiding the unused date window.

### Which movement is most accurate?

All three have the same accuracy specifications. Real-world accuracy depends more on regulation and individual movement variance than the specific model.

### Are these movements serviceable?

Yes, any watchmaker familiar with Seiko movements can service these. Parts are widely available, and the movements are well-documented.

### Can I regulate these movements myself?

Yes, with a timegrapher and some practice. However, professional regulation is recommended for beginners.

### Which has the best resale value?

NH35A watches typically have the best resale due to their popularity and broad appeal. However, a well-executed build with any movement will hold value.
