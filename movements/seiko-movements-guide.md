# Understanding Seiko Movements: A Complete Guide

## What is a Watch Movement?

A watch movement (also called a caliber) is the engine that powers a watch. It's the mechanism that measures the passage of time and drives the hands. For Seiko mod watches, choosing the right movement is fundamental to your build.

## Types of Watch Movements

### Automatic (Self-Winding)
Most common in Seiko mods. The rotor spins with wrist movement, winding the mainspring.

**Advantages:**
- No battery needed
- Mechanical charm
- Appreciation value
- Sustainable/eco-friendly

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires regular wear or winder
- Less accurate than quartz
- Higher maintenance needs

### Manual Wind
Requires daily winding via the crown. Less common in mods but used in vintage builds.

**Advantages:**
- Traditional watchmaking experience
- Thinner case possible
- Direct connection to timekeeping

**Disadvantages:**
- Daily winding ritual required
- Easy to forget to wind
- Not as convenient

### Quartz
Battery-powered, extremely accurate. Rarely used in "true" Seiko mods but has its place.

**Advantages:**
- Very accurate (±15 seconds/month)
- Low maintenance
- Always ready to wear

**Disadvantages:**
- Less "enthusiast appeal"
- Battery replacement needed
- Not traditional modding territory

## Key Movement Features Explained

### Hacking

**What is it?**
Pulling the crown to the time-setting position stops the seconds hand.

**Why it matters:**
- Allows precise time synchronization
- Essential for setting time to the exact second
- Standard feature in NH series, absent in 7S series

**Practical Use:**
When setting your watch to an atomic clock or phone, hacking lets you stop the seconds hand at zero, set the time, then start it precisely at the next minute change.

### Hand-Winding

**What is it?**
Ability to manually wind the watch via the crown, like a traditional mechanical watch.

**Why it matters:**
- Convenient if you haven't worn the watch recently
- Ensures full power before timing events
- Traditional mechanical experience

**How to use:**
With crown at position 1 (first pull), rotate clockwise about 40 times to fully wind. You'll feel resistance when fully wound - don't force it.

### Power Reserve

**What is it?**
How long the watch runs when fully wound without additional winding.

**Typical Reserves:**
- NH series: ~41 hours
- 7S series: ~40 hours
- 6R series: ~50 hours

**Practical Impact:**
With a 41-hour power reserve, if you take your watch off Friday night, it will still be running Monday morning. This is convenient for rotating between watches.

### Jewels

**What are they?**
Synthetic ruby bearings that reduce friction in the movement.

**Jewel Count:**
- 7S26: 21 jewels
- NH series: 24 jewels
- 6R15: 23 jewels

**Does it matter?**
More jewels generally means less friction and wear, but the difference between 21 and 24 is minimal in practice. It's more about placement than quantity.

### Beat Rate (Vibrations Per Hour)

**What is it?**
How many times per hour the balance wheel oscillates.

**Common Rates:**
- 6 beats/second = 21,600 vph (NH, 7S, 6R series)
- Higher beats = smoother seconds hand sweep

**Visual Impact:**
21,600 vph produces the classic smooth "sweep" that mechanical watch enthusiasts love, as opposed to the "tick" of quartz watches.

## Movement Accuracy

### Factory Specifications

**NH Series:** -20 to +40 seconds per day
**7S Series:** -20 to +40 seconds per day
**6R Series:** -15 to +25 seconds per day

### Real-World Performance

Many NH movements perform better than spec, often achieving:
- +5 to +15 seconds per day with regular wear
- Better accuracy in the "dial up" position
- Improved accuracy after break-in period

### Regulation

Movements can be regulated (adjusted) for better accuracy:
- **DIY Regulation**: Requires timegrapher tool ($100-$300)
- **Professional Regulation**: $30-$75 at watchmaker
- **Expected Result**: +/- 5 seconds per day achievable

### Position Variance

Accuracy changes based on watch position:
- **Dial Up**: Often most accurate
- **Crown Up/Down**: May gain or lose time
- **Wrist Wear**: Averaging effect usually improves accuracy

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which movement should I choose for my first mod?

**NH35A** - Most versatile, best parts availability, proven reliability.

### Are NH movements as good as movements in real Seiko watches?

Yes! NH movements ARE Seiko movements. They're the same as 4R movements but sold without Seiko branding for aftermarket use.

### How long do these movements last?

With proper care and regular service, NH movements can last decades. They're the same movements used in Seiko's production watches.

### Can I swim with an NH35 movement watch?

The movement itself is not waterproof. Water resistance depends entirely on proper case sealing, gaskets, and assembly. A properly built and tested watch can be water-resistant to 100m+.

### Do I need to wind my automatic watch daily?

No. Wearing it regularly provides winding through wrist motion. If not worn for 2 days, it may stop. Hand-winding or a watch winder solves this.

### Why is my movement gaining/losing time?

All mechanical movements have accuracy variance. Position, temperature, and wear patterns affect accuracy. Regulation can improve accuracy.
