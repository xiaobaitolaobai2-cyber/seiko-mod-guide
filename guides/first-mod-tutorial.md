## Step 2: Movement Preparation

### Inspect the Movement

1. **Remove from Packaging**
   - Use tweezers, never touch with bare hands
   - Hold by the edges only
   - Place on movement holder

2. **Check Movement Function**
   - Gently wind the crown 10-15 times
   - Verify seconds hand moves smoothly
   - Test hacking (pull crown to position 3)
   - Test date change (if NH35)

3. **Clean the Movement**
   - Use dust blower to remove any particles
   - Check for factory oils or residue
   - Ensure date wheel is clean and aligned

### Install Movement Spacer Ring

Most NH35 movements require a 0.3mm spacer ring for proper case fit.

1. **Locate the Ring**
   - Thin metal ring, about 28mm diameter
   - Usually brass or stainless steel

2. **Install the Ring**
   - Place movement on holder
   - Carefully slide ring over movement
   - Ensure it sits flush against movement edge
   - Ring should not interfere with rotor

**Important**: Some cases don't require spacers. Check your case specifications.

## Step 3: Dial Installation

This is where your build starts to come to life!

### Align Dial Feet

1. **Identify Dial Feet Positions**
   - Look at back of dial
   - Note two small metal feet
   - These must align with movement holes

2. **Locate Movement Holes**
   - NH35 has two dial feet holes
   - Usually at 12:30 and 6:00 positions
   - Some dials have 3:00/9:00 positions

3. **Test Fit the Dial**
   - Gently place dial on movement
   - Feet should slide into holes easily
   - Dial should sit flat, not tilted

### Secure the Dial

1. **Position Dial Carefully**
   - Use tweezers to hold dial edges only
   - Never touch the dial face
   - Align feet with movement holes

2. **Press Gently**
   - Apply light, even pressure
   - Dial should click into place
   - Check that dial doesn't move when touched

3. **Verify Alignment**
   - Check that 12 o'clock position is straight
   - Verify date window alignment (if applicable)
   - Ensure dial sits flat against movement

**Common Issues:**
- **Dial won't sit flat**: Feet may be bent, carefully straighten
- **Date window misaligned**: Dial feet in wrong holes, reposition
- **Dial moves**: Feet not fully inserted, press again gently

   - Press firmly until hand is secure
   - Should sit above hour hand with clearance

4. **Test Clearance**
   - Gently rotate time forward
   - Watch hands should not touch
   - If they touch, remove and reinstall

### Install Seconds Hand

1. **Prepare Seconds Hand**
   - Most delicate hand
   - Handle with extreme care
   - Any bend will affect timekeeping

2. **Position Seconds Hand**
   - Place over seconds post
   - Align with 12 o'clock position
   - Must clear minute hand

3. **Press Very Gently**
   - Seconds hand requires very light pressure
   - Too much pressure bends the hand
   - Should sit above minute hand

4. **Test Function**
   - Wind movement slightly
   - Watch seconds hand sweep
   - Verify it clears other hands and dial

### Final Hand Check

1. **Rotate Time Forward**
   - Use crown to advance time
   - Watch all hands through full rotation
   - Check for any interference

2. **Verify Alignment**
   - All hands should point exactly at 12 when aligned
   - Hands should be parallel to dial
   - No hands should be bent or touching

**Pro Tips:**
- If a hand is misaligned, remove and reinstall (don't try to adjust while installed)
- Use Rodico to clean hands before installation
- Work under magnification for precision
- Practice hand setting on a cheap movement first

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Hands Touching

**Problem**: Hands interfere with each other
**Solution**: Remove hands, reinstall with better clearance

### Watch Won't Wind

**Problem**: Crown turns but movement doesn't wind
**Solution**: Check stem connection, ensure stem release button isn't stuck

### Date Won't Change

**Problem**: Date doesn't advance at midnight
**Solution**: Verify date wheel alignment, check dial feet installation

### Crystal Fogging

**Problem**: Condensation inside crystal
**Solution**: Watch not properly sealed, check gaskets and reassemble

### Bezel Won't Click

**Problem**: Bezel rotates smoothly but doesn't click
**Solution**: Check bezel spring, may need replacement

### Movement Stops

**Problem**: Watch stops after short time
**Solution**: Ensure movement is fully wound, check for hand interference

## After Your First Build

### Break-In Period

- New movements may need 1-2 weeks to reach optimal accuracy
- Wear regularly to allow automatic winding to optimize
- Accuracy typically improves with use

### Water Resistance

**Important**: Home-built watches should not be considered water-resistant unless properly tested.

- Hand washing: Probably safe
- Swimming: Not recommended
- Diving: Definitely not

**Professional pressure testing** recommended if water resistance is important ($20-$40 at watchmaker).

### Maintenance

- Wind occasionally if not worn daily
